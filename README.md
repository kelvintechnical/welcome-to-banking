# Welcome to Learning React! 🌟

This project is my **first React project**, and it was a fantastic learning experience. I built a simple React app to practice **state management**, **handling user input**, and **dynamic rendering**.

---

## 📝 Project Description
This app demonstrates a **user-friendly interface** where:
- A user can input their **name**.
- A user can input their **account balance**.
- The app dynamically displays the entered **name** and **account balance**.

It’s a basic project, but it helped me understand core concepts of React and CSS styling.

## 🎓 What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

1. **React Basics:**
   - Using **functional components** to structure the app.
   - Understanding **JSX** and how it makes writing UI in JavaScript simple and intuitive.

2. **React State Management:**
   - Learning about **`useState`**, React’s hook for managing state.
   - Understanding destructured arrays, where:
     - The first value stores the current state.
     - The second value is a function to update that state.

3. **Dynamic Rendering:**
   - Displaying values entered by the user dynamically in the app.
   - Using curly braces `{}` to include JavaScript variables in JSX.

4. **Event Handling:**
   - Handling user input with the **`onChange`** event to update state dynamically.

5. **CSS Styling:**
   - How to style elements globally and how global styles can unintentionally affect other elements.
   - The importance of **using class-specific styles** to avoid unexpected issues.
   - Using **Flexbox** to center elements both horizontally and vertically.

6. **GitHub Workflow:**
   - How to push a React project to GitHub, including:
     - Initializing a Git repository.
     - Committing and pushing changes to GitHub.
